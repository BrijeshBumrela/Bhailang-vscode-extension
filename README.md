## Requirements

make sure to install bhailang with &nbsp; `npm i -g bhailang` 

## Note
This is a dummy extension used for toy programming language. Disable it when not in use :)

## Needs to be done
This extension still lacks the intellisense, Although I'm not sure if bhailang will need any

**Enjoy!**
